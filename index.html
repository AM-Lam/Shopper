            <p id="descriptionText">Born 1958 on Melville Island, Timothy Cook began paintings on canvas in the mid
                1990s. At the start of his career he was one of a number of Tiwi artists who visited the South
                Australian Museum in Adelaide to view the bark paintings on canvass collected by anthropologist Charles
                Mountford during his National Geographic expedition to Melville Island in 1954. The visiting artists
                were inspired to create contemporary responses and Cook quickly became one of the most radical
                interpreters of these early Tiwi works.

                The traditional Tiwi ceremony of kulama (or yam) is a recurrent subject in Cookâ€™s work, and its circular
                motif has several echoes in Tiwi culture. This ceremony is a coming-of-age ritual that occurs when the
                kulama yams are harvested. It is performed in the early dry season around a circular fire-pit when a
                conspicuous halo appears around the full moon.Elders of both sexes sing and dance for three days
                welcoming the boys into adulthood. The boy is then renamed with his true man's name. The moon is a
                potent metaphor for life and death in the Tiwi Islands. It is home to the adulterous Tapara from the
                Tiwi mortuary narrative of Pukumani, which also features Purukapali, his wife Waiyai, and their baby son
                Jinani.
